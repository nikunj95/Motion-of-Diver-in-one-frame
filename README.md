Given a video of the diver diving into the pool, it separates the foreground (Diver) from the background and outputs a single image comprising of different postures of the diver when he/she made the dive.

It is a C++ implementation and uses OpenCV.

Edit the path to video file. Then Compile and run diver_posutres.cpp to get the output.
